  <h1>My experiments with truth
  </h1>
  <h3>by Mahatma Gandhi</h3>

<p>The book "My experiments with truth " an autobiography of one of the eminent leader and an ascetic " Mahatma Gandhi " starting from his childhood describes the complete life of Gandhi . It breaks the commonly presumed conception about Gandhi being a pious person abstaining himself from worldly attractions since birth . It shows how Gandhi being a normal person like us changes into an altruistic being leaving a profound impact worldwide evolving into a Mahatma and the hardships faced by him . This book very well portrays how our inner self always interrupt us from doing anything erroneous but only he who prioritise his inner self has the ability to bring a change and inspire others .
</p>

  <p class="quote-header">One of his quotes which has left an indelible impact on me ,
</p>
  <p class="quote"> " If I believe I cannot do something , it makes me incapable of doing it. But when I believe I can , then I acquire the ability to do it even If I didn't have it in the beginning".
</p>
<p><em>This book is a must read if you are an adulator of Gandhi , some people may find it monotonous at times but overall it's one of an unprecedented autobiography . </em></p>

  <h1>Calling Sehmat </h1>
  <h3>by Harinder Sikka</h3>

<p>So, this book is not only about an Indian Spy who puts her life in risk for the country saving it from a catastrophic event but also about what challenges she has to face to do such a job and still be the one who goes unsung and is seldom remembered . A biography which lays out the memoir of an ordinary middle class North Indian girl who takes up her progenitor's profession for the love of her country and family and how she saves her country from a huge mishap , consequently , gambling with her own life.This book also unveils how being involved in such a work can metamorphose your whole life , makes you sacrifice your feelings and why you can never be the same ever again .</p>

<p>This book has also turned into a motion picture named "Raazi" which very briefly describes Sehmat's life . What fascinated me the most after watching the movie which led me reading this appreciable biography is how a shy and timid girl being afraid of ammunitions turns into a fearless and patriotic spy . This moving life story will leave you with an everlasting impression and let you question yourself what are you doing to contribute to your nation . Also , it will make you feel proud of such great unsung patriots.</p>

<p><em>You must read this book if you are looking for a story which goes deep into the intricacies in the life of a spy and make you realise why such people are worth venerating !  </em></p>

  <h1>The last lecture by Randy Pausch with Jeffrey Zaslow</h1>
  <h3>by Randy Pausch with Jeffrey Zaslow</h3>

<p>We often are very fed up with our lives and tend to search for something that gives us a new ray of hope , which makes us believe that there's so much more to this world , This book "The last lecture " is about the same , which recounts the life of an award winning teacher and researcher , Randy Pausch , who inspite of having every odds in his favour chose to be happy and kept others around him gratified  . We find him as a man who has great affection for his family and how he left no stones unturned to keep them happy , despite of suffering from a critical illness as precarious as Cancer and knowing his life would end soon ,eventually leaving his beautiful family of 3 children and his wife . His last lecture at Carnegie Mellon University is available on internet and clearly exhibits his cheerful nature and optimistic personality . No doubt , being in such a egregious condition and still managing to keep yourself happy is the most difficult thing a person can think of and that's really inspiring and worth getting appreciated . But what i felt while reading this book , while in some pages we get really inspired and moved by his audacious words . Other times , it went too dreary.
</p>
<p> <em>If you are one of those readers who wants every page of the book to be something that doesn't stultifies you and leaves an impact this book is not for you . On the contrary , if you are one of those readers who is not concerned in how much you got to learn from a single book you can definitely go and read this book ! </em> </p>
  <p class="quote-header">As i mentioned in some areas there are really impacting words from this zestful individual , i would like to quote one of the many ,
</p>
  <p class="quote"> " Follow your passions, believe in karma, and you won't have to chase your dreams, they will come to you. "

  <h1>Ignited Minds
 </h1>
  <h3>by APJ Abdul Kalam</h3>

<p>It's one of the many books written by this amazing man. This is not one of those books in which he shares about how he , along with his team successfully completed launching rockets and stuff. But more about his experiences and interaction with students and his belief in how these young minds have the capability of changing the world.There's not much description about things in this book as it's a short one and emphasizes more on young minds and Kalam's initiative to enlighten them. Like all of his books this one also isn't the one where you will read and think " Oh ! I haven't learnt anything new ". You'll invariably gain something when it comes to Sir Kalam elucidating his experiences and thoughts .
There's always some piece of highly impressive words in a book that leaves me awestruck , quoting one of those from the author ,</p>
  <p class="quote"> "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool."
  </p>

<p><em>You should definitely read this book it instills how each one of us has the capability of collectively making big changes and how we can see this world with a different and broader perspective!

<h1>The Alchemist</h1>
<h3>by Paulo Coelho</h3>
<p>
  Do you remember when we were kids we used to read short stories which gave us a moral in the end ? While reading it initially, we were often puzzled as to what is it about but slowly we got to realise it ."The Alchemist" is somewhat similar to those stories the difference being it gives you lesson that you wouldn't understand if you were to read it back then !  It's about a shepherd named Santiago who had a dream about finding treasure underneath the pyramids and how he listened to his heart and followed his dream.Although, he had to face a lot of difficulties but he ended up getting what he was searching for , it teaches us when someone has an ardent desire for something how the paths keep forming which we get to realise much later. This book tells us how following our heart is not at all serene , we often have to jump out of our comfort zones to conquer what we are looking for.
</p>

<p> <em>Words that come too frequently in this book and holds much importance in our lives as well ,</em> </p>
<p class="quote"> "When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."
</p>
<p> <em>It's a wonderful piece of writing by Paulo Coelho as it beautifully explains how journey of pursuing the goal is much more magnificent than the goal itself .
You'll be surrounded with a bunch of positivity while you decipher this book so you should definitely read this one!</em> </p>
